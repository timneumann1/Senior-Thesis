# Senior Thesis: "On m-general sets in AG(k,q) and PG(k,q): Sidon sets, projective arcs and error-correcting codes"

This is the code accompanying my Senior Thesis. In particular, this repository contains Python and Matlab scripts that explore m-general sets for m = 3,4,5 in affine and projective space in small dimensions over the Galois fields of order 2 and 3.
