# Senior Thesis m-general-sets

This is the code accompanying the Senior Thesis "On m-general sets in AG(k,q) and PG(k,q): Sidon sets, projective arcs and error-correcting codes."
In particular, this repository contains Python and Matlab scripts that explore m-general sets for m = 3,4,5 in affine and projective space in small dimension and over the fields F_2 and F_3.
